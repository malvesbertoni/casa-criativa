# Casa Criativa (Creative Home)

This is an app for registering and sharing creative ideas to do during this quarantine time.

The concept of this project was born during the first weeks of the covid quarantine and was introduced by a Dev Workshop.

PS. I am aware that the files, and the organization itself, are a bit messy, but this was the first project that I've done in a long time. I could (and I might) refactor it, though I like to keep things as they were so I can go back and see how much I've progressed.
